suploy-scli (Server Command Line Interface)
===========================================
The project aims to provide a consistent and simple to use API to access
the core __suploy__ functionality. This is important to separate the 
repository and docker management from the web interface and thereby 
simplifying the execution of administrative tasks from the command line.

The tool is not connected to the user database.
